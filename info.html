            <h2>About the Conference</h2>
            <p>
                The Model United Nations (MUN) Conference is a prestigious and educational event where students
                simulate the workings of the United Nations. Participants act as delegates representing different
                countries and engage in debates and discussions on various global issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                MUN conferences provide an excellent platform for students to develop their diplomatic and public
                speaking skills while gaining a deeper understanding of international affairs and global challenges.
